Space Tramp
===========

Some kind of space game. Ideally it will have lots of combat in a universe
to explore. Think an action oriented FTL with star trek themes mixed in.

Right now, all you can do is fly and warp around with a buddy ship.

Running
-------

This program is written in Lua using Love2D 0.10.2.

I've been developing under Ubuntu 16.04 using Love2D's PPA

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install love
    cd space-tramp
    love .

Also works on android!

    Go to https://love2d.org/ and download the android runtime.

    Run "make build" to generate SpaceTramp.love. Copy this to your phone.

    Open the .love file with a file browser, open with the love app.
    (File Manager + seems to work well)

No reason this shouldn't work on iOS too, but I haven't tested that.
